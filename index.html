			<h2>Power Of Light</h2>
			<p>
				This chapter focuses on how to install an enterprise-class Cisco router, with just enough configuration
				to get the router working. You might recall, when you buy a Cisco LAN switch, you
				can just plug in all the Ethernet cables, power on the switch, and by default, the switch works.
				However, the Cisco routers used by companies require at least some configuration before the
				router will start routing IPv4 packets. In particular, the router needs to be told what interfaces to
				use and what IP address to use on each of those interfaces.
				This chapter breaks the topics into two major headings. The first discusses the physical installation
				of an enterprise-class Cisco router. The second section looks at the command-line interface
				(CLI) on a Cisco router, which has the same look and feel as the Cisco switch CLI. This section
				first lists the similarities between a switch and router CLI, and then introduces the configuration
				required to make the router start forwarding IP packets on its interfaces.

				Routers collectively provide the main feature of the network layer—the capability to forward
				packets end to end through a network. As introduced in Chapter 4, “Fundamentals of IPv4
				Addressing and Routing,” routers forward packets by connecting to various physical network
				links, like Ethernet, serial links, and Frame Relay, and then using Layer 3 routing logic to choose
				where to forward each packet. As a reminder, Chapter 2, “Fundamentals of Ethernet LANs,”
				covered the details of making those physical connections to Ethernet networks, while Chapter
				3, “Fundamentals of WANs,” covered the basics of cabling with WAN links.
				This section examines some of the details of router installation and cabling, first from the enterprise
				perspective and then from the perspective of connecting a typical small office/home office
				(SOHO) to an ISP using high-speed Internet.
				Product vendors, including Cisco, typically provide several different types of router
				hardware, including some routers that just do routing, with other routers that serve other
				functions in addition to routing. A typical enterprise branch office needs a router for WAN/
				LAN connectivity, and a LAN switch to provide a high-performance local network and connectivity
				into the router and WAN. Many branches also need Voice over IP (VoIP) services
				and several security services as well. (One popular security service, Virtual Private Networking
				[VPN], is covered in Chapter 5, “Fundamentals of TCP/IP Transport and Applications.”) Rather
				than require multiple separate devices at one site, as shown in Figure 15-2, Cisco offers single
				devices that act as both router and switch, and provide other functions as well.
				Following that concept further, Cisco offers several router model series in which the routers
				support many other functions. In fact, Cisco has several router product series called Integrated
				Services Routers (ISR), with the name emphasizing the fact that many functions are integrated
				into a single device. However, for the sake of learning and understanding the different functions,
				the CCENT and CCNA exams focus on using a separate switch and separate router,
				which provides a much cleaner path for learning the basics.
